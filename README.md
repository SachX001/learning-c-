## 🚀Factorial Calculator (C++)

This is a simple C++ program that calculates the factorial of a number using a do...while loop.

📜 Description

The program takes an integer input from the user and prints the factorial of that number.
It continues multiplying until it reaches 1, following the formula:
N! = N*N(N-1)*(N-2)*(N-3)...1

🛠️ Features

Uses do...while loop to demonstrate iterative logic.

Handles 0! correctly (prints 1).

Simple and beginner-friendly code.


## 🚀 Reverse Array in C++

This is a simple C++ program that reads an array of integers from the user and prints the elements in reverse order.

📖 How It Works

 1.Takes input N – the number of elements in the array.

 2.Reads N integers from the user.

 3.Prints the elements in reverse order, separated by spaces.

 🖥️ Example

   Input:
   5
   2 4 5 6 8

## 🚀 Comma-Separated Number Parser

A simple C++ program that reads a string of comma-separated numbers from standard input, parses them using `stringstream`, and prints each number on a new line.

 🚀 Features
- Takes input as a **single string** containing numbers separated by commas (e.g., `10,20,30`).
- Uses `vector<char>` to store characters before converting to a string.
- Utilizes `stringstream` to separate numbers from commas.
- Prints each number on its own line.

 📋 Example
### Input:
10,20,30,40

 Output:
10
20
30
40

 🛠️ How It Works
  1. **Store Input in `vector<char>`**  
   Reads the string character by character and stores it in a `vector<char>`.

  2. **Convert Vector to String**  
   Reconstructs a string from the `vector<char>` so that it can be processed by `stringstream`.

  3. **Parse Numbers with `stringstream`**  
   Extracts each integer from the string and consumes commas in between to prepare for the next number.

 🎯 Learning Highlights

   1.Working with vector<char>

   2.Converting vector<char> to std::string

   3.Parsing formatted input using stringstream

   4.Handling separators (commas) while extracting integers

 📂 Use Cases

 🖥️ Code Overview

- **Class:** `Student`
- **🔒 Private Members:** `age`, `firstName`, `lastName`, `standard`
- **🌐 Public Methods:**  
  - **Constructor:** Initializes student data  
  - **🖨️ printDetails():** Prints all the student information  

🧠 Concepts Used

## 🚀Ceil Division of Product (`ceil_division.cpp`)
 
### 🎓 Problem Overview

Given multiple test cases, each with two integers `n` and `x`, we need to compute:

\[
\text{answer} = \left\lceil \frac{n \times x}{4} \right\rceil
\]

In simpler terms, we:

- Multiply `n` and `x`
- Divide the result by `4`
- Round the result **up** to the nearest integer

This is a common pattern in competitive programming when calculating the **minimum number of groups / batches / units** needed, where each group can handle `4` units at most.

### 🚀Input Format

- The first line contains an integer `t` — the number of test cases.
- Each of the next `t` lines contains two integers `n` and `x`.

     5 1 5 2 5 3 5 4 x
     
    ❌ Incorrect Input Example:
     5 1 5 2 5 3 5 4

   Without a non-integer at the end, input parsing may not terminate as expected.

  ### 🧱 Code Breakdown
  🔹 Solution Class

   Private Logic:
    Uses a count vector to store frequency of each element
    Iterates through the array to count occurrences manually
   
   Public Method:
    repeatedNTimes(vector<int>& nums) →
    Counts how many times each element appears
    Finds the maximum frequency
    Returns the element corresponding to that frequency

  ### ⏱️ Time & Space Complexity

## 🏛️ Roman Numeral to Integer Conversion (C++)

### 📌 Overview

This project implements a **Roman numeral to integer converter** in C++ using a **brute-force, fundamentals-driven approach**.

Instead of relying on STL maps or one-line tricks, the solution explicitly models:

* Roman symbol → value mapping
* Additive numeral logic
* Subtractive numeral corrections

The focus is **clarity, correctness, and understanding**, not shortest code.

---

### 🎯 Problem Statement

Given a Roman numeral string `s`, return its integer value.

Roman numerals follow these rules:

* Symbols usually **add** their values
* If a **smaller value appears before a larger one**, it is **subtracted**

#### Examples

```
III      → 3
IV       → 4
IX       → 9
MCMXCIV  → 1994
```

---

### 🧠 Design Philosophy

This solution is intentionally split into **two logical passes**:

1. **Additive Pass**
   Convert each Roman symbol to its integer value and compute the total sum.

2. **Correction Pass**
   Detect subtractive pairs (`IV`, `IX`, `XL`, `XC`, `CD`, `CM`) and subtract their correction values from the initial sum.

This separation keeps the logic:

* Easy to reason about
* Easy to debug
* Aligned with brute-force fundamentals

---

### 🧱 Data Structures Used

#### 🔹 Fixed-Size Arrays (Symbol Mapping)

```cpp
char Roman_NumberSet[7] = {'I','V','X','L','C','D','M'};
int Integer_NumberSet[7] = {1,5,10,50,100,500,1000};
```

These arrays simulate a dictionary-like mapping **without using STL maps**, keeping memory usage minimal and predictable.

---

#### 🔹 Vectors

* `Value_set` → stores integer values corresponding to each Roman character
* `diff_value` → stores correction values for subtractive pairs

Both vectors remain small (bounded by the input length).

---

### ⚙️ Algorithm Breakdown

#### Step 1: Symbol Conversion

* Iterate through the input string
* Match each Roman symbol with its numeric value
* Store values in `Value_set`

#### Step 2: Initial Summation

* Sum all values from `Value_set` into `initial_sum`

#### Step 3: Subtractive Pair Detection

* Scan the string for known subtractive pairs:

  * `IV`, `IX`
  * `XL`, `XC`
  * `CD`, `CM`
* Push corresponding correction values into `diff_value`

#### Step 4: Final Calculation

* Sum all correction values into `diff_sum`
* Compute result as:

```cpp
final_value = initial_sum - diff_sum;
```

---

### 📊 Complexity Analysis

#### ⏱ Time Complexity

* **O(n)**
  Two linear passes over the input string

#### 🧠 Space Complexity

* **O(n)**
  Small auxiliary vectors proportional to input length

---

### 🧪 Example Walkthrough

Input:

```
MCMXCIV
```

Processing:

```
Initial sum   = 2216
Corrections   = 200 + 20 + 2
Final result  = 1994
```

Output:

```
1994
```

---

### 💡 Why This Approach?

* Avoids abstraction-heavy STL containers
* Makes Roman numeral rules explicit
* Reinforces fundamentals of arrays, loops, and conditionals
* Demonstrates multi-pass problem solving

Despite its simplicity, the solution is **memory efficient** and performs competitively.

---

### ⚠️ Notes

* This solution prioritizes **learning and clarity**
* It is not the most concise implementation
* Intended as a stepping stone toward optimized or STL-based solutions

---

### 🏁 Conclusion

This project demonstrates that:

* Complex problems can be solved with simple tools
* Clear logic often outperforms clever shortcuts
* Understanding fundamentals leads to better optimization decisions later

A solid, readable, and correct Roman numeral conversion implemented from first principles.
