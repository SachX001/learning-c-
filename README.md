# learning C++ :
Collection of C++ codes and small projects i made in my freshman year.

This repository contains the collections of beginner friendly projects i made while learning programming concepts.
The goal is to build a strong foundation by practicing small problems step by step. 

## ðŸ“‚ Folder Structure

- **learning-c-/** â†’ Programs that use custom functions
  -square_numbers.cpp â†’ Calculates and prints squares of the numbers in a user defined range.
  ## ðŸš€ Program: square_numbers.cpp

  ### Description
This program demonstrates:
- Using a function to calculate squares of numbers
- Iterating over a range with a for-loop
- Basic input/output in C++

### Example Usage
Enter starting and ending numbers:
1 5

Output:
1 - 1
2 - 4
3 - 9
4 - 16
5 - 25

### Learning Objectives
- For Loops
- Functions
- Input/Output
- Variables and scope
- Problem-solving basics

  
- (More folders will be added as I learn new concepts)
