# learning C++ :
Collection of C++ codes and small projects i made in my freshman year.

This repository contains the collections of beginner friendly projects i made while learning programming concepts.
The goal is to build a strong foundation by practicing small problems step by step. 

## 📂 Folder Structure

- **learning-c-/** → Programs that use custom functions
  -square_numbers.cpp → Calculates and prints squares of the numbers in a user defined range.
  ## 🚀 Program: square_numbers.cpp

  ### Description
This program demonstrates:
- Using a function to calculate squares of numbers
- Iterating over a range with a for-loop
- Basic input/output in C++

### Example Usage
Enter starting and ending numbers:
1 5

Output:
1 - 1
2 - 4
3 - 9
4 - 16
5 - 25

### Learning Objectives
- For Loops
- Functions
- Input/Output
- Variables and scope
- Problem-solving basics


## 🚀 Program: TriangleDeterminer.cpp
This is a simple C++ program that takes the lengths of three sides of a triangle as input and determines whether the triangle is:

- **Equilateral** – all three sides are equal  
- **Isosceles** – any two sides are equal  
- **Scalene** – all sides are different  

 📌 How It Works

The program uses basic `if-else` conditions to compare the sides and classify the triangle

🚀 Usage:
1. Compile the code:
   g++ triangle.cpp -o triangle

2.Run the executable:
 ./triangle

3.Enter three side lengths (float or int):
 5 5 8

4.Output:
 isosceles

💻 This is part of my daily practice to improve problem-solving and C++ skills.


## 🚀Factorial Calculator (C++)

This is a simple C++ program that calculates the factorial of a number using a do...while loop.

📜 Description

The program takes an integer input from the user and prints the factorial of that number.
It continues multiplying until it reaches 1, following the formula:
N! = N*N(N-1)*(N-2)*(N-3)...1

🛠️ Features

Uses do...while loop to demonstrate iterative logic.

Handles 0! correctly (prints 1).

Simple and beginner-friendly code.
